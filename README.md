# Phénakisticope

Touch-based animation of historic phénakisticope illustrations (fun on the iPad).

# Background

In 1832, long before the invention of modern cinema, Belgian scientist Joseph Plateau created the illusion of a moving image through a series of revolving discs, a device which he called the Phenakistoscope. This repository recreates this mystifying early form of animation on touch capable devices, such as the iPad or iPhone.
